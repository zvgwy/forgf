# 💌 My Cute Little Web Invitation

Sooo I made this super simple website to invite my girlfriend on a date (hi baby if you’re reading this 😭).  
I’m literally a total beginner at coding — like 10.00 % knowledge — but I wanted to try making something sweet from scratch.

## 🌸 How it works:

1. **First page**  
   There’s a message that says *“I have something important to tell you…”*  
   ➤ Two buttons:
   - **“ok…?”** → takes her to the next part  
   - **“idc”** → takes her to a page where I cry because ouch 😭

2. **Anniversary page**  
   If she clicks "ok…?", it says  
   *“Congrats to us, we’ve been together for a month!!”*  
   ➤ Two buttons again:
   - **“ok, and…?”** → same result as clicking "idc" (suffering)  
   - **“YAYYY!!!”** → finally leads to the actual date ask

3. **Movie date page 🎬**  
   I ask her out to a movie date with another image and two buttons:  
   - **“YES”** → opens the Google Form for the date plan  
   - **“no”** → keeps running away so she can’t click it 😏

## 🛠 How to run it (if you’re not her lol):

1. Make sure you have all the files in one folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
   - and the assets folder 
2. Open the entire folder in VS Code
3. Open `index.html` in your browser (you can also use Live Server)
4. That’s it!

## 🧸 Extra notes:

- This was made with 99% heart and 1% actual coding knowledge
- The "texts" are actually images and you can't change it in the script. However, I can give you the canva link so you can edit it yourself and replace what I put.
- The “no” button really does dodge your mouse — I’m proud of that one hehe
- To replace the link at the end, navigate through the gform.html and replace my link with yours e.g. <a href="YOUR_GFORM_LINK".
- If you want to host the program through github like I did, you can look up how to use github pages in the internet.
